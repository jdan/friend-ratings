## Project Roadmap

I'll be hacking on this project from 12:00AM EST - 2:00AM EST (June 30th, 2012). Hopefully I'll make some progress.

RateMyFriends is a fun way to leave 1-5 star ratings for your friends. Think amazon, or yelp reviews, except they're really stupid and hold no merit. Be silly, be creative, be anonymous!

It takes no account to sign up. Simply make a new page with your friend's name (or your own!) and begin. Links to pages are private.

The homepage will show a simple example of a friend rating, and a link to get started. Dead simple.

## Details!

* Admins will have a control panel and a report queue (to remove bad words, slanderish ratings, etc). 
* Mobile layout (mobile app?)
* Creating a page requires a security question and answer (for removal requests)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Fork it, commit it, pull request it - BAM! Be descriptive, I don't have much direction for this project, but collaborating with others in such a short time period is tough. We'll see how it goes.
